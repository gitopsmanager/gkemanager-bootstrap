# One stage of terraform/create-cluster: init against the cluster's own state,
# plan, and apply that exact plan (or stop at the plan).
#
#   run_terraform_stage.sh <stage> <project> <cluster> <state-bucket> <plan|apply> <tfvars>
#
# The GKE create's copy of eksmanager-bootstrap's script: the same graceful
# stop; state in GCS (gs://<bucket>/projects/<project>/clusters/<cluster>/<stage>/).
#
# STAGE_DIR, when set, is the module to run instead of terraform/create-cluster/<stage>
# (Config Connector's identity: terraform/cluster-identities/cnrm, stage identity-cnrm).
# The state is .../clusters/<cluster>/<stage>/ either way.
#
# NO_DESTROY=1: the plan is refused, before anything is applied, when it would
# delete or replace anything (an identity update may add and change, never
# remove: scripts/plan_guard.py).
#   run_terraform_stage.sh --stop     after a cancel: let Terraform stop gracefully
#
# Terraform: this calls `terraform` (terraform/README.md).
#
# Graceful stop. GitHub kills a cancelled step about 10 seconds after the
# cancel, too soon for Terraform to finish the changes in flight, write its
# state and release its lock. So plan and apply, the commands that lock the
# state, run apart from the step (terraform_session.py, in a session of its own)
# and the step only watches them. On a cancel:
#   - this step sends Terraform ONE interrupt, its graceful stop: it finishes
#     what it is changing, writes the state, releases the lock and exits.
#     Never two: a second interrupt makes it exit at once.
#   - the workflow's `if: cancelled()` step runs --stop, which sends that
#     interrupt if this step didn't get to, and waits for Terraform to end.
#     A lock left behind is removed only when it is this runner's and no
#     Terraform is running (the workflow's concurrency group means no other
#     run can hold it).
# init and output run in the step as before: init takes no lock, and output
# only reads.
